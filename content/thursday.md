Finally able to make some website structure. I wanted to do this for a
long time. I am happy about this.

Plan for 2014:\
 This is year already packed with work/personal commitments. Couple of
things I would like to achieve in 2014 would be:\
 1. Run half marathon. Registered for a race on March 8th.\
 2. Give GMAT in April.\
 3. Document my daily progress in log section.\
 4. Not to overwhelm with plenty of things to do.\
 5. Eat very clean, gluten-free/vegan.\
 6. Meditate 15mins everyday.\
 7. Minimize useless internet browsing.
